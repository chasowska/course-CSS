# CSS course completed

For the first time, I discovered a wonderful platform with numerous programming courses - Udemy. To begin with, I was advised to take a CSS course by Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller and Manuel Lorenz - [CSS - The Complete Guide 2024 (incl. Flexbox, Grid & Sass)](https://www.udemy.com/course/css-the-complete-guide-incl-flexbox-grid-sass/?couponCode=LETSLEARNNOW), and it was a very positive experience for me.

I was able to better organize my knowledge and supplement it sufficiently ü§ì

### Within the course, I covered the following topics:

- The basics about selectors, combinators and how you set up styling rules in general
- Properties, values and decalarations
- How specifity and inheritance work and why it's called "Cascading" Style Sheets
- Important theoretical concepts like the "Box Model"
- How the default position of elements can be changed
- Styling backgrounds (e.g. gradients) and images
- Which units and dimensions you typically use in CSS (px, rem, % and more)
- How JavaScript and CSS interact
- Responsive design and what "Mobile First" means
- Styling forms and form inputs
- Working with text, fonts and text styles
- Flexbox! How it works and how to use it
- Using the CSS Grid and how it differs from Flexbox
- Transforming and animating HTML elements with the help of CSS
- Writing future-proof CSS with features like CSS variables or best-practice class names
- Using Sass and what it actually is all about

### My personal tasks
1. Improve my knowledge of CSS.
2. Learn to create websites with multiple pages.
3. Enhance my skills in using Flexbox.
4. Finally understand when and how to correctly use Grid.
5. Learn to create responsive websites.
6. Practice working with images when creating a website.
7. Try using Sass.

*These are not all the gaps I managed to fill after completing the course, but they are certainly the main ones.*

Throughout the course, I reviewed the practical material covered by the instructors and independently completed practical tasks. Upon completing the course, I managed to create a multi-page website using almost all the topics provided in the course üëÄ

I also received a small bonus - a certificate üòÅ üéâ

**Now I'm trying to independently apply the knowledge I've gained in the next learning projects.**
